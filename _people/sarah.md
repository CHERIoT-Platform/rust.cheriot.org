Harris has extensive experience with the Rust programming language, and with experimental systems programming. She has worked on the Atomic Weapons Establishment initiative to provide a trusted disassembler for AVR code, and on functional verification of the QEMU emulator for the AVR architecture. Her systems programming skills drive the changes needed to port the Rust compiler to the Morello architecture.
